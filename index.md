### The Pantheon Project: Reproducible Workflows for Extreme Scale Science

Scientific computing is a complex undertaking, involving a myriad of technologies - specialized hardware, software, configurations and version control - all working together to produce large scale data and scientific insight.

An outstanding need is a way to preserve, communicate and validate workflows that cross all of these boundaries, providing both real examples of end-to-end workflows, and permanent records of these workflows for archival purposes.

The *Pantheon* project aims to meet this need by providing immutable, reproducible, and reusable experiment pipelines on target infrastructures. Panthon provides:

- A community-based standard for reproducible large scale scientific workflows. A workflow in the Pantheon project has been tested against a set of published criteria. If it's in Pantheon, it works, and is a useful example.
- A federated set of reproducible workflows. Creating large scale scientific workflows is complex, so working examples are a valuable product. We provide these examples as:
    - Examples of *real* workflows for experimentation, learning and archiving. 
    - A permanent working record of milestones.
- Reproducibility for exploratory research. Early software development efforts have unique build requirements and suffer from inconsistent versioning practices. The focus of Pantheon is to capture the state of a working experiment.
