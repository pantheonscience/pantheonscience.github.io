This is the current set of projects publishing workflows through *Pantheon*. To get started with your project, [contact us](mailto:pantheon-help@lanl.gov).

## The Exascale Computing Project (ECP)

{% include ecp_image_link.html %}


A prime motivation for *Pantheon*, and a first example of its use is for the [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/). ECP is a cross-cutting project that brings together advanced work in computer architectures, scientific simulations, in-situ and post-processing data analysis, systems and workflows. One component of the ECP project is examples of workflows across applications, in-situ analysis and post-processing analysis. 

### Repositories
- The [ECP-Artifacts](https://github.com/pantheonscience/ECP-Artifacts/tree/master/artifacts) repository records workflows submitted as Milestones for the ECP project. These serve as:
    - Permanent records of the ECP Milestones
    - Examples and starting points for those wondering how a science simulation, the in-situ infrastructure, and post-processing work on the target platform.

- The [ECP-Examples](https://github.com/pantheonscience/ECP-Artifacts/tree/master/artifacts) repository is a set of examples using ECP applications, in-situ and post-processing capabilities. These serve as:
    - A set of *how-to* examples for ECP workflows
    - A starting point for your own explorations. Start from something that works end-to-end and adapt it for your own needs.
