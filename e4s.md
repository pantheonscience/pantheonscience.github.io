The Pantheon and E4S projects are collaborating to advance the integration and testing of capabilities, and to promote understanding of the complex workflows utilized by the ECP project.

The Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack ((E4S))[https://e4s.io/] is a "community effort to provide open source software packages for developing, deploying and running scientific applications on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. E4S provides from-source builds and containers of a broad collection of HPC software packages. ([1])[https://e4s.io/]

- **The Pantheon Project** captures and curates immutable, reproducible, and reusable experiment pipelines on target infrastructures.

- **The E4S Project** simplifies the deployment of complex HPC software by creating pre-built binaries of packages that may be installed natively using an E4S build cache, or through a container-based software stack. Containerized deployments may use either full-featured or base E4S containers that may be customized and can use the E4S build cache. E4S uses the Spack package manager for software delivery. 

## Repositories

Pantheon workflows that take advantage of E4S deployment are found [in this repository](https://github.com/pantheonscience/ECP-E4S-Examples).
